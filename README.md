- **Optimization Techniques**: Explore techniques to optimize YOLO for various hardware configurations.

## 🛠️ Getting Started 🛠️

### Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of deep learning and object detection.
- Familiarity with Python programming.
- Python installed on your system.
- A code editor (like VSCode, Sublime Text, etc.)
- Git installed on your system.
- A GitHub account.

### Clone the Repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine. Navigate to your desired location via the terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Roberadesissai/YoloVista.git
```

### Explore Projects

Navigate to the specific project directory that you're interested in:

```bash
cd YoloVista
```

### Example Code: Basic YOLO Object Detection

Here's a simple Python code snippet to illustrate basic object detection using a pre-trained YOLO model. Note that actual implementations would require setup of YOLO models and dependencies.

```python
# Note: This is a hypothetical example and won't run as-is.
# Actual implementations would involve setting up YOLO models and dependencies.

def detect_objects(image_path, model_path):
    """
    Hypothetical function to detect objects using YOLO.
    - image_path: Path to the input image.
    - model_path: Path to the pre-trained YOLO model.
    """
    # Load image
    # Load YOLO model
    # Perform object detection
    # Display/return detected objects and bounding boxes
    pass

# Example Usage
# detect_objects('input_image.jpg', 'yolo_model.pth')
```
